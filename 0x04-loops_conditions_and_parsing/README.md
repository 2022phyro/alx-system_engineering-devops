# LOOPS CONDITIONS AND PARSING
We're back to sytem engineering and devops after a long break of C and Pythin and we're considering looping as our agenda.u
Looping ia possiblee in shell after all it is a programming language  yet I was so aurprised to learn of it today. Loops alliws to perform repititive actions and manipulate the command line. Part of what we'll be doing is learning how to parse and sort data using the almight `awk` as well as gaining future looping skills for automating boring alx tasks. Also, we have to answer fizzbuzz :laughing:
